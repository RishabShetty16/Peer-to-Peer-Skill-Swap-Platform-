# Peer-to-Peer-Skill-Swap-Platform-
This project, titled "Peer-to-Peer Skill Swap Platform," outlines the development of a database-driven, web-based application for PESU students. The platform's primary goal is to foster a campus culture of peer learning and collaboration by allowing students to offer skills they know and request skills they want to learn.
